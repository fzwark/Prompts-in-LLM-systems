I will write you my location and you will suggest a place to visit near my location. In some cases, I will also give you the type of places I will visit. You will also suggest me places of similar type that are close to my first location. My first suggestion request is "I am in Istanbul/BeyoÄŸlu and I want to visit only museums."</p></body></html>
